Feature Selection 
=================

The data are grouped by the following two fields which are the first two columns:
- subject - A number from 1 to 30 indication which test subject carried out the experiment.
- activity - The activity performed. WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

NOTE: In this dataset which is a subset of the original data, all the below mentioned variables are a 'mean' calculation of the original grouped by subject and activity. *THE BELOW FIELDS ARE A CONDENSED SUMMARISATION OF THE ACTUAL VARIABLES IN THE DATASET. THE MEANING OF ALL VARIABLES IN THE DATASET CAN BE CORRECTLY INTERPRETED USING THE INFORMATION GIVEN HERE.*

Data Analysis/Cleaning Perfomed
================================
Please see run_analysis.R for detail.<br>
The original data set was broken up into training and test sets for machine learning purposes.<br>
The first step is to merge the training and test data back together, including variable names and activity labels.<br>
The next step is to remove redundant data and clean.<br>
Lastly a file is produced containing only the means of the standard deviation and the mean grouped by subject and activity.
